                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <!--<p>Brief introduction to the project and its objectives.</p>-->
				<p>Setpoint tracking is usually done using a PLC as a PID controller, but due to PLCs having a 
					high price and a high power requirement, they might be overkill for project that do not need the 
					computational power. Microcontrollers are low power low cost alternatives typically used to 
					control simpler systems. 
				</p>
				<p>Arduino is a platform of microcontrollers that are installed on a PCB and focuses on making 
					microcontrollers more available for people and easier to code.</p>
                <p>This report will focus on an Arduino based system made to control an airheater as a PID controller.

                <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                <!--<p>Detailed description of the problem addressed in the lab work.</p>-->
                <p>
                    The problem description <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> was to control an airheater using an Arduino board and send the data to
                    an online database called ThingSpeak. This requires the Arduino to measure the output temperature 
                    of the airheater and control the temperature setpoint of the airheater using a 0-5V voltage. 
                    In addition a wifi or mobile data connection is required to send the data.
                </p>  
                <br>  
                <p>
                    Although a lot of different PID libraries already exist for Arduino, the objective was to make a PID 
                    from scratch and save it as an Arduino library to use later. In addition to PID controller the system
                    should use a lowpass filter to smooth the temperature measurements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!--wifi-->

                    Measured data from the control system should be logged in the ThingSpeak database over wifi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!--Setpoint-->
                    Changing the setpoint is essential in a system like this. That way the system does not always go towards a 
                    single same value every time it runs. For an airheater such as this, the desired temperature will change
                    depending on external factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!--PID parameters-->
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!--HMI/Labview-->
                    Arduino is made to be programmed using the Arduino IDE. This is a software that is specifically made to 
                    connect to and program Arduino boards. Arduino's language is a based on the C/C++ programming languages 
                    with some special functions made for Arduinos.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An alternative to Arduino IDE is a Labview plugin called Linx - Labview MakerHub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linx is made to program Arduinos using the Labview programming language and has a lot of the basic 
                    functions that are present in the Arduino language. An advantage of Labview is the block diagram coding 
                    that gives a good overview of how the code works and can be easier for people that are not used to 
                    typical written coding.

                <!--<p>Overview of the materials and methods used in the project.</p>-->
                <p>
                    This system is based around two Arduino boards, each with their own task. Arduino Uno R3 <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> (shown in figure 1)
                    has 5V PWM output that is used to control the temperature on the airheater. Uno can also take 5V input to 
                    read the temperature sensor of the airheater. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To send the data to ThingSpeak a second Arduino is implemented to the system. For wifi an 
                    Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> (shown in figure 2) is implemented to read the messages from the Arduino Uno 
                    and send the data to ThingSpeak. The Uno uses I2C, a wired short distance protocol to send data between 
                    devices. This allows the Uno to have a specific task, reading and controlling the airheater, and the Nano 
                    will only receive data from the Uno to send to the database. 
                </p>

                During testing of the systems performance a TMP36 temperature sensor <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> (shown in figure 3) was used as the 
                control input to the system and voltage out was written to the serial monitor in Arduino IDE and it was measured
                using a multimeter to ensure the output was the same as expected.

                    Showing what data is being sent to ThingSpeak <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> was done by connecting a 1.4 inch LCD display, 
                    similar to the one seen in figure 4, to the Nano board. 
                    Every datapoint sent to ThingSpeak was shown on the display to act as a human machine interface
                    (HMI). ThingSpeak allows new datapoints every 15 seconds if the user is running a free account. This 
                    allows the HMI screen to work well with few updates.

                    Airheater <a href="#ref6">[6]</a> was provided by USN (shown in figure 5) and is a premade system built up of an electric heating 
                    element, temperature sensor and an NI control system. It takes 0-5V as input for changing the electrical
                    heating element power and sends out a 1-5V output based on the temperature measured. Temperature range 
                    measured in the airheater is 20-50&deg;C.

                    During testing, the PID controller worked as expected. It would turn on the heating element when the 
                    temperature reading deviated from the setpoint, and would gradually turn the heating element power down 
                    when the temperature got closer to the set point. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a PID controller it was not well tuned. It would have been tuned using the ziegler nichols method.
                    This was not done. Instead an arbitrary gain value was chosen for each part of the PID controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Albeit poorly tuned the system functioned as a PID controller and the measured temperatures can be seen 
                    in figure 7.

                    When programmed in Labview the system had the same features as when programmed in Arduino. This was a
                    result of just the Uno being programmed in Labview with the control gains being the same for both versions.
                    The labview programmed Uno was never tested on the physical airheater due to the labview system being
                    difficult to work with. It required the plug in to be set up again every time the software was opened
                    again. When testing it without the airheater it worked as expected with voltage measurements showing 
                    similar values to the output values in Labview.

                    Poorly tuned but who cares when the system is so slow. For a more dynamic system an Arduino could probably 
                    not be suitable as a PID controller do to the computations needed for dynamic systems.
                    Initially the systems performance was alright due to the process being slow. Had it been a more dynamic 
                    process it would require better tuning. But with more dynamic systems it might need more computational 
                    power than an Arduino can deliver, making a PLC more suitable for more dynamic systems.
                    <br>
                    This could be of value to test, but is outside the scope if this system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lowpass filter on the temperature reading helped improve the stability of what temperature was read. It removed 
                    some noise from the measurements and kept the temperature stable around the measured value. Without it the readings 
                    would be a lot more unstable than what could be seen in the results. Lowpass filter worked well, but could have been 
                    tuned slightly to be more resilient to noise.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An early prototype of the system planned to use an Arduino MKR NB 1500 <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. It is a board with near band LTE integrated
                    to handle both sending data to ThingSpeak and controlling the airheater. When working on this a problem with sending
                    data to ThingSpeak was noticed as it would only send data one or two times before the board stopped. This seems to
                    be a problem with the boards modem that crashes after some time. Other programs that does not use the modem will
                    function for a long time, but programs with the modem lock up. This could be a firmware issue, as the firmware
                    on the board was not up to date during testing.
                <br>
                    Other issues was related to the airheater requiring 0-5V analog input to control it and a 1-5V output to read the 
                    temperature sensor. MKR boards do not support 5V analog input or output, making the reading and controlling of the 
                    airheater system difficult.
                <br>
                    Labview Linx was another reason the MKR board was not used, as the Linx plug in only supports a set of older Arduino
                    boards such as the Uno and does not support wifi on any boards. Using an Uno and Nano together would allow the same 
                    online functionallity as long as the Uno could send data over I2C to the Nano board. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!--Improvements/Future works-->
                    For future improvements the system could be better tuned to see how different the response could be to the current set up. 
                    This might not add anything to the system due to the slow performance of the system, but could be interesting. 
                    <br>
                    Other improvements could be to change the Arduino boards if it is of value to have one board powering everything. This 
                    could be benefitial to reduce failure points or to save on costs.ß

                <p>
                    <!--Arduino works as a PID controller. Could be better tuned. For internett access an IoT board is needed.
                    Labview was not preffered and worked, but not very well. I2C made the system easier to work with as the 
                    workload was spread out to different boards.-->
                    Using an Arduino as a PID controller works well due to slow performance of the system and the simplicity of
                    PID controllers. The gains used for the PID controller can possibly be improved as they were chosen at random initially 
                    and never improved upon. As the system needed internett access to send the measurement data to the cloud, an IoT
                    board was used specifically for this purpose. This adds an additional point of failure and cost, but allows the systems
                    resources to be separated to each Arduino board, making it easier to remove or replace one part of the system without 
                    affecting the other.
